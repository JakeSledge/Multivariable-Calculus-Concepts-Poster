# Multivariable-Calculus-Concepts-Poster
This was a poster made in my high school's multivariable calculus class for a final project. The math was written in LaTeX with some figures being taken from James Stewart's Calculus: Concepts and Contexts. The poster was assempled in illustrator.

When opening the illustrator file, it will ask you to link to the PDFs in the PDFs folder of this repo as well as the PNG files in the mathpics folder of this repo.
